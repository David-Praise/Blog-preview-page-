## My process
I coded the basic componets that would be present on the page using html, then proceeded to work on positioning of all the element on the page aswell designing all the elments on the page using css
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Strangly enough i learnt how to actually learn from others code and research code that i dont know in order to improve my own, I used to the kind of person that was stuck in tutorial hell and beleived i couldnt move past it, I was honestly convinced that if i cant memorize every syntax then i cant make it as a programmer, Now i know that you only need an understanding of the mechanics behind the code not the code itself. 

I also learnt of a nice way to position html elements more efectively on a page, Which i could also apply to position elements in a div.In this case it was used to centre the box in the centre 
```css
body{
    position: relative;
    min-height: 100vh;
  }
.box{
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    Top: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development
I hope to improve on my ability of research in order to use resources online to find the code i am looking for to improve my own.
